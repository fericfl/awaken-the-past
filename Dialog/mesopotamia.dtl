Localnic: Oh, hello there! You don’t look like you’re from around here. Are you lost? I could use some help.
Localnic: I had a very special story, carved onto three clay tablets. It’s the tale of Gilgamesh, the great hero! But I’ve lost the tablets somewhere around the village. I need all three to tell the full story.
Localnic: Could you help me find them? If you bring back all three, I’ll share the story with you—and I think it might be the key to your next journey!
